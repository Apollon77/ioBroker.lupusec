Requires node.js 6.0 or higher and Admin v3!

This adapter connects the Lupusec alarm system XT1 Plus, XT2, XT2 Plus and XT3 with ioBroker.
The XT1 (without Plus) will not be supported. You can read the status of the Lupusec sensors
like door, windows, water, smoke sensors and the status of the alarm system.
You can turn on switches and arm/disarm the alarm system.


You can find detailed information here: [Lupus](https://www.lupus-electronics.de/en)

## Installation

1. Install the adapter
The easiest way is to configure the lupusec.iobroker adapter via the discovery adapter in ioBroker. The discovery adapter search for the right IP-address of the Lupusec alarm system. The other way is it, to configure it manually

2. Manually configuration of the adapter
Choose the IP-Address or hostname from the Lupusec alarm system. Choose https (recommended) if possible.
For only reading the status, select a user without write access. If you want to change the status
(for example, turn on/off the light or arm/disarm the alarm) pick a user with write access.


By default all Lupssec devices will be on the ioBroker object tab  displayed.

  - Door contact / window contact (Type 4)
  - Water sensor (Type 5)
  - Motion detector (Type 9)
